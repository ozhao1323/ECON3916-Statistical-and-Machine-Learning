# **Economic Data Science Portfolio**

Welcome to my digital portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. This repository showcases my work as I learn to connect the rigor of economic reasoning with the power of modern data science. My goal is to demonstrate how tools from statistics, machine learning, and causal inference can work together to answer real economic questions.

## **About This Portfolio**

This repository contains my coursework, labs, and applied projects from ECON 3916.  
The course follows a *Concept Extension* philosophy: we begin with foundational statistical tools—such as linear regression, hypothesis testing, and model diagnostics—and extend them using machine learning techniques like regularization, cross‑validation, and high‑dimensional prediction.

Throughout the portfolio, I focus on developing the ability to:

- Combine **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**
- Translate economic intuition into data‑driven workflows
- Evaluate models not only for accuracy, but for interpretability and policy relevance
- Use computational tools to scale traditional econometric ideas into modern ML contexts

This space reflects my growth as an undergraduate student exploring roles in **data analysis**, **economic consulting**, and **finance**, and my commitment to bridging economic theory with practical, data‑driven insight.
