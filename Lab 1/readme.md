# **Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis**

This project applies the Big Mac Index to evaluate whether international currency prices align with the **Law of One Price**, using Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) as the theoretical benchmark.

---

## **Objective**
To assess whether cross‑country Big Mac prices are consistent with the Law of One Price by computing implied PPP exchange rates and identifying currency overvaluation or undervaluation relative to the U.S. dollar.

## **Methodology**

- Constructed a custom dataset using Python dictionaries based on **The Economist’s 2015 Big Mac Index**.
- Loaded and organized the data using **Pandas** for structured analysis.
- Calculated each country’s **Implied PPP exchange rate** by comparing local Big Mac prices to the U.S. benchmark.
- Computed **currency misalignment** by measuring the percentage deviation between market exchange rates and implied PPP.
- Interpreted results through an economic lens, focusing on deviations that suggest potential overvaluation, undervaluation, or arbitrage opportunities.

## **Key Findings**

Based on the 2015 Big Mac data, I identified notable disparities between market exchange rates and their PPP‑implied counterparts. For example:  
- **[Insert finding here]**, indicating that the currency was **overvalued/undervalued by X%** relative to the U.S. dollar.  
- These deviations highlight how real‑world frictions—such as transportation costs, market segmentation, and local pricing power—prevent perfect arbitrage and cause persistent departures from the Law of One Price.

This lab demonstrates how a simple consumer good can serve as a practical tool for evaluating global currency valuation, blending economic theory with hands‑on data analysis.
